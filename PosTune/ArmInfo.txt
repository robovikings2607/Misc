Arm position control info

1 motor rev = .0035 arm rev = (84/24/5/5/4) = 1.26deg

100 motor turns = 1 output shaft turn on planetary   (100 / 5 / 5 / 4)

6087 RPM max, 41560 native 

encoder position is reversed (forward voltage generates negative position/velocity)

6087 RPM / 60sec = 101.45 RPS

Feedforward = 1023 / 41560 = 0.02461501443695861405197305101059
